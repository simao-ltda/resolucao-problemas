Divercity
-----------


Divercity is an extension of MicropolisJ which is Micropolis for the Java platform, which implements several new features and improvements over the original MicropolisJ.
It was developed during a three-week programming course in 2014 at Freie Universitaet Berlin by Arne Roland, Benjamin Kretz, Estela Gretenkord i Berenguer, Fabian Mett, Marvin Becker, Tom Brewe, Tony Schwedek, Ullika Scholz, Vanessa Schreck. (also see last two sections on this readme for author statements of the predecessor versions)

`java -jar micropolisj.jar`

Attention: 
Enabling sound might result in a slower UI experience.


new Features
-------------
* **more realistic traffic**: we replaced old traffic generation with A* path finding. We generate paths from residential areas along roads and rails, is a road heavily used it's getting less likely for new cars to use that road, so the traffic balances.
  * visits to buildings influence game variables like growth of zones, police efficience, culture effect etc. Visits are generated with our new traffic simulation
  * police and fire efficience is dependent on the traffic and transportation situation as well now. instead of a fixed radius, a breadth-first-search is used now to determine the effect area, making it much more realistic 
* **new buildings**:
  * *school*: generates education points, is necessary to build a university
  * two types of *university*: generates education points, enables research by right clicking or using the query tool
  * *museum*: generates a culture effect
  * *open air area*: generates a culture effect
  * *city hall*: adds a new city center which increases the landvalue around it. Also statistics can be views by right clicking or using the query tool on it
  * *big park*
  * *Energy*: wind power plant and solar power plant can be researched in a university
  * *transportation*: new big road type, rails now need a station to be used
* **research**: in each of the two new universities continuos improvements can be researched as well as unlocking special buildings, such as the new power plants is possible there
* **improved graphics**: we tweaked some colors to be more eye pleasing
  * new splash screen
* **more realistic pollution spreading**: we now use a gaussian distribution to spread pollution around the map
* **usability improvements**: scolling with keyboard arrows works now
* **bug fixing**
